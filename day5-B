1.Cumulative Sum
The cumulative sum of an array at index i is defined as the sum of all elements of the array from index 0 to index i.

Examples
Initial Array: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Cumulative Sum: [1, 3, 6, 10]
Initial Array: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Cumulative Sum: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

2.Positive Cumulative Sum

The cumulative sum of an array at index i is defined as the sum of all elements of the array from index 0 to index i.
  Examples
Initial Array: [1, -2, 3, 4, -6]
Cumulative Sum: [1, -1, 2, 6, 0]
Positive Cumulative Sum: [1, 2, 6]
Initial Array: [1, -1, -1, -1, 1]
Cumulative Sum: [1, 0, -1, -2, -1]
Positive Cumulative Sum: [1]

3.Identical Twins

For an array of integers nums, an identical twin is defined as pair (i, j) where nums[i] is equal to nums[j] and i < j.

Examples
Array: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
Number of Identical Twins: 2
Explanation:
Identical Twins: [[1, 1], [2, 2]]
Indexes: (0, 4), (1, 3)
  output:2

1.left rotate by one
Example 1:
Input: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 2,3,4,5,1
Explanation: 
Since all the elements in array will be shifted 
toward left by one so ‘2’ will now become the 
first index and and ‘1’ which was present at 
first index will be shifted at last.

2.linear search
Problem Statement: Given an array, and an element num the task is to find if num is present in the given array or not. If present print the index of the element or print -1.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: arr[]= 1 2 3 4 5, num = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is present in the 2nd index
