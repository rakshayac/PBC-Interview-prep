1.Cumulative Sum
The cumulative sum of an array at index i is defined as the sum of all elements of the array from index 0 to index i.

Examples
Initial Array: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Cumulative Sum: [1, 3, 6, 10]
Initial Array: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Cumulative Sum: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

2.Positive Cumulative Sum

The cumulative sum of an array at index i is defined as the sum of all elements of the array from index 0 to index i.
  Examples
Initial Array: [1, -2, 3, 4, -6]
Cumulative Sum: [1, -1, 2, 6, 0]
Positive Cumulative Sum: [1, 2, 6]
Initial Array: [1, -1, -1, -1, 1]
Cumulative Sum: [1, 0, -1, -2, -1]
Positive Cumulative Sum: [1]

3.Identical Twins

For an array of integers nums, an identical twin is defined as pair (i, j) where nums[i] is equal to nums[j] and i < j.

Examples
Array: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
Number of Identical Twins: 2
Explanation:
Identical Twins: [[1, 1], [2, 2]]
Indexes: (0, 4), (1, 3)
